This is a small set for UI effects.

The asset includes two shaders, one shader for text, the second for sprites.<br>
Shaders allow you to get various effects, not just a smooth change in transparency (see examples).

The asset includes a script that changes the transparency of the text.<br>
You can change the alpha channel for several texts at once by setting different parameters.
